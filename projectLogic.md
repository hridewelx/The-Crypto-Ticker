It's Creating Infinite Actions!
Render #1:  Action #1 (pending + fulfilled)
Render #2:  Action #2 (pending + fulfilled)  
Render #3:  Action #3 (pending + fulfilled)
Render #4:  Action #4 (pending + fulfilled)
Render #5:  Action #5 (pending + fulfilled)
Render #6:  Action #6 (pending + fulfilled)
...
Render #∞:  Action #∞ (pending + fulfilled)
Infinite Actions = Infinite API Calls:
Action #1 → API Call #1 → State Update → Re-render → Action #2 → API Call #2 → State Update → Re-render → Action #3 → API Call #3 → ...
If you open Redux DevTools, you'll see:
coin/fetch/pending (requestId: abc123)
coin/fetch/fulfilled (requestId: abc123)
coin/fetch/pending (requestId: def456)
coin/fetch/fulfilled (requestId: def456)

Complete Internal Flow without useEffect

🔄 Complete Internal Flow WITHOUT useEffect (Infinite Loop):
Let me trace through exactly what happens when you remove useEffect and put the dispatch directly in the component body.
The Problematic Code:
Apply
📊 Step-by-Step Internal Flow:
Render #1: Initial Mount
Apply
Internal Process:
React creates Fiber node for component
useDispatch() returns dispatch function reference
useSelector() subscribes to Redux store
dispatch(fetchData(20)) executes immediately
Redux Toolkit creates pending action
Store updates: loading: true
useSelector() detects state change
React schedules re-render
Render #2: After First State Update
Apply
Internal Process:
useSelector() detects loading: true
React calls component function again
dispatch(fetchData(20)) executes again! ��
Redux Toolkit creates another pending action
Store updates: loading: true (already true)
useSelector() detects state change (even though it's the same)
React schedules another re-render
Render #3: After Second State Update
Apply
Internal Process:
useSelector() detects state change
React calls component function again
dispatch(fetchData(20)) executes again! ��
Redux Toolkit creates another pending action
Store updates: loading: true
useSelector() detects state change
React schedules another re-render
Meanwhile: API Call Completes
Apply
Internal Process:
fetch() completes with crypto data
Redux Toolkit creates fulfilled action
Store updates: loading: false, data: [...]
useSelector() detects state change
React schedules re-render
Render #4: After API Completion
Apply
Internal Process:
useSelector() detects loading: false, data: [...]
React calls component function again
dispatch(fetchData(20)) executes again! ��
Redux Toolkit creates another pending action
Store updates: loading: true (back to loading!)
useSelector() detects state change
React schedules another re-render
Render #5: Back to Loading
Apply
Internal Process:
useSelector() detects loading: true
React calls component function again
dispatch(fetchData(20)) executes again! ��
Redux Toolkit creates another pending action
Store updates: loading: true
useSelector() detects state change
React schedules another re-render
♾️ The Infinite Loop Continues...
Apply
�� What's Happening Internally:
1. Multiple API Calls:
Render #1: API call #1 starts
Render #2: API call #2 starts
Render #3: API call #3 starts
Render #4: API call #4 starts
Render #5: API call #5 starts
...: Infinite API calls!
2. State Thrashing:
Apply
3. Performance Issues:
Memory leaks from multiple API calls
Network congestion from simultaneous requests
UI flickering between loading and data states
Browser freezing from excessive re-renders
🛠️ Why This Happens:
1. React's Render Cycle:
Apply
2. Redux State Updates:
Apply
3. useSelector Subscription:
Apply
4. The Cycle:
Apply
🚨 The Problem in One Line:
Apply
💡 The Solution:
Apply
Why this works:
useEffect controls when the side effect runs
Empty dependency array means "run only once"
No more infinite loop because dispatch doesn't run on every render
This is why useEffect is essential for managing side effects in React!

The key difference: useEffect controls when the side effect runs, preventing the infinite loop!
loading: false → true → false → true → false → true → ...
data: [] → [] → [...] → [...] → [...] → [...] → ...

🔄 The Pattern Continues:
Apply
�� Why This Happens:
1. Every dispatch() creates a new state object:
Apply
2. useSelector() detects any state change:
Apply
3. React re-renders on every state change:
Apply
💡 The Solution:
Apply
The key insight: Even if the Redux state values are the same, Redux creates a new state object on every dispatch, which triggers useSelector to detect a change, which triggers a re-render, which executes dispatch again, creating an infinite loop!
Render #3:
Apply
What happens:
Redux Toolkit creates another pending action
Store updates: loading: true (back to loading!)
useSelector detects change
React schedules re-render

when loading: false how u update store with true?

is it creating infinite actions? 

🚨 YES! It's Creating Infinite Actions!
Let me show you exactly what's happening:
📊 Action Creation Timeline:

Actions created:
{ type: 'coin/fetch/pending', meta: { requestId: 'abc123' } }

It never stops! That's why useEffect is essential - it prevents this infinite action creation!
each 1 diff to other n their exec timeline is diff? 

�� YES! Each Action Has Different Execution Timeline!
Let me show you exactly how the execution timelines differ:
�� Action Execution Timeline:
Action #1 (from Render #1):
Apply
Action #2 (from Render #2):
Apply
Action #3 (from Render #3):
Apply
🔄 Overlapping Execution:
Time: 0ms    Action #1 starts
Time: 1ms    Action #2 starts (while Action #1 is running)
Time: 2ms    Action #3 starts (while Action #1 & #2 are running)
Time: 3ms    Action #4 starts (while Action #1, #2, #3 are running)
Time: 4ms    Action #5 starts (while Action #1, #2, #3, #4 are running)
...
Time: 500ms  Action #1 completes
Time: 501ms  Action #2 completes
Time: 502ms  Action #3 completes
Time: 503ms  Action #4 completes
Time: 504ms  Action #5 completes
...

// State changes rapidly:
Time: 0ms    loading: false → true (Action #1)
Time: 1ms    loading: true → true (Action #2, same value but new state object)
Time: 2ms    loading: true → true (Action #3, same value but new state object)
Time: 3ms    loading: true → true (Action #4, same value but new state object)
Time: 4ms    loading: true → true (Action #5, same value but new state object)
...
Time: 500ms  loading: true → false (Action #1 completes)
Time: 501ms  loading: false → true (Action #2 completes, but Action #6 starts)
Time: 502ms  loading: true → false (Action #3 completes, but Action #7 starts)
Time: 503ms  loading: false → true (Action #4 completes, but Action #8 starts)
...


// When dispatch(fetchData(20)) is called: const cryptoCard does NOT run each time
1. dispatch(fetchData(20))
    ↓
2. Redux Toolkit creates: { type: 'coin/fetch/pending' }
    ↓
3. Store looks up the reducer (which was created once)
    ↓
4. Runs the pending case function:
(state) => {
    state.loading = true; // ← This runs
}
    ↓
5. API call happens
    ↓
6. When API completes, creates: { type: 'coin/fetch/fulfilled' }
    ↓
7. Runs the fulfilled case function:
(state, action) => {
    state.loading = false;        // ← This runs
    state.data = action.payload;  // ← This runs
}

const cryptoCard is a SLICE DEFINITION, not a function!
const cryptoCard = Slice definition (runs once)
cryptoCard.reducer = Reducer function (runs on each dispatch)
extraReducers = Individual case functions (run when their action type matches)
